# futFriends

futFriends is a web application that allows friends to schedule watch parties for upcoming games at a specific location and time. It provides features to send invitations to friends, browse upcoming games, and create watch parties from them.

## Features

- **Watch Party Scheduling**: Users can schedule watch parties for upcoming games, specifying the location and time for the event.
- **Invitations**: Users can send invitations to their friends to join the watch parties. Friends will receive notifications about the upcoming watch party and can RSVP.
- **Game Lookup**: Users can browse through a list of upcoming games and select games to create watch parties from.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: The application's front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes React, a modern JavaScript framework for creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Back-end**: The back-end is implemented using Ruby on Rails, a server-side technology. It handles user authentication, database operations, and API integrations.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, a relational database management system is used to store user information, watch party details, game data, and user details.
